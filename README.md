Welcome to my Procedurally Generated Terrain repository! Building upon the foundational knowledge of generating terrain, this project takes a step further into the vast world of procedural generation. Currently, this project showcases the implementation of procedurally generated terrain using various methods and algorithms. The next phase, which is currently in the works, aims to bring procedurally generated streets, eventually paving the way to full-fledged cities.

The dream is to have an intricate cityscape, brought to life from the ground up, with every nook, cranny, street, and skyline uniquely created by algorithms.

Current Features:

Procedurally Generated Terrain: Using multiple techniques, the project currently offers diverse terrain landscapes. These terrains serve as the base upon which our future cities will stand.
Roadmap:

Procedurally Generated Streets: The next big milestone! Streets are the veins of any city, and this upcoming feature will weave roads in unique patterns across our terrains.
Procedurally Generated Cities: The grand vision! Following the streets, the project aims to populate the landscape with buildings, parks, landmarks, and more.
Contribution & Feedback:

This project is an evolving landscape (pun intended). While the journey from terrains to cities is challenging, contributions, suggestions, and feedback will go a long way in refining the end product.

Note: As the project is in its developing stages, some features are still being worked on. Kindly be patient, and keep an eye out for exciting updates!
