Welcome to the Procedurally Generated Terrain Repository. This platform expands upon the fundamental principles of terrain generation, integrating advanced procedural generation methodologies. Currently, the repository provides insights into terrain generation using multiple algorithms and methods. The subsequent phase, now under development, will incorporate algorithms for procedurally generated streets, culminating in comprehensive city models.

Objective: Develop algorithmically-constructed cityscapes, ensuring every element—from basic terrain to complex urban designs—is generated with precision and uniqueness.

Current Features:

Procedurally Generated Terrain: Through the application of several techniques and computational algorithms, the project delivers a range of terrain topographies. These serve as the foundational structures for subsequent urban development.
Development Roadmap:

Procedurally Generated Streets: Streets form the core infrastructure of urban models. The forthcoming addition to the repository will algorithmically construct streets, ensuring integration with the existing terrains.

Procedurally Generated Cities: The long-term goal is the creation of algorithmic cityscapes. After establishing the street networks, the endeavor will be to populate these terrains with algorithmically generated structures, parks, landmarks, and other urban elements.

Contribution & Feedback:

The project's trajectory, from terrain development to comprehensive urban designs, is complex and requires continuous refinement. Contributions in the form of algorithm enhancements, feedback, and suggestions are invaluable for the project's evolution.

Note: As the project is actively under development, certain functionalities are in their refinement stages. We appreciate your patience and encourage regular visits for the latest algorithmic advancements.
